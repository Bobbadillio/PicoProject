# IoT Hackday code

It's been a while since the event, but I had a blast at IoT Hackday in 2022. I've been interested in IoT and programming on microcontrollers for years. I've had an arduino sitting in my basement for maybe four years, but this event was a great opportunity to go out and dedicate time to making progress!

In one day, I went from never having written my own code that runs on a microcontroller to blinking an LED, then grabbing someone's code to run a webserver on a Raspberry Pi Pico W and modifying it to present a web page that allows people to run a web page that sets up and then runs Conway's game of life on the LED strip!

It was a great day, and I learned a lot.

## A Disclaimer

This code is pretty messy! The Conway game of life stuff works, but I was scrambling at the last minute of the event to figure out what it wasn't performing updates correctly. It's especially tempting in personal projects to hesitate to publish until things are "perfect". Despite my opinion that this code is pretty ugly and rough, it DOES work and I've been trying to make a commitment to get code out there even if it doesn't meet the standards I'd want to see.
