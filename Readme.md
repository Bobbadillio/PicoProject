# IoT Hackday code

It's been a while since the event, but I had a blast at IoT Hackday in 2022. I've been interested in IoT and programming on microcontrollers for years. I've had an arduino sitting in my basement for maybe four years, but this event was a great opportunity to go out and dedicate time to making progress!

In one day, I went from never having written my own code that runs on a microcontroller to blinking an LED, then grabbing someone's code to run a webserver on a Raspberry Pi Pico W and modifying it to present a web page that allows people to run a web page that sets up and then runs Conway's game of life on the LED strip!

It was a great day, and I learned a lot.
